        <h2>Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecommunications Industry</h2>

        <p>
            This project focused on analyzing customer data to predict churn in the telecommunications industry.
            The goal was to identify the key factors that contribute to customer attrition and develop machine
            learning models to predict which customers are most likely to churn. This analysis enables proactive
            customer retention strategies, ultimately reducing customer loss. The data source for this analysis
            is Kaggle.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>

        <p>
            The analysis involved several key steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data
            analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. I utilized Python and
            various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, XGBoost to perform
            these tasks. The primary objective was to build accurate and reliable predictive models and derive
            insights from the data to inform business decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Pandas</li>
            <li>NumPy</li>
            <li>Seaborn</li>
            <li>Matplotlib</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn</li>
            <li>XGBoost</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation Details</h3>

        <h4>Data Loading and Preprocessing</h4>

        <p>
            The customer churn data was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. The initial steps involved checking for
            missing values and handling them appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, missing values were observed in columns like 'Offer', 'Multiple Lines', 'Internet Type',
            'Online Security', 'Online Backup', 'Device Protection Plan', 'Premium Tech Support', 'Streaming TV',
            'Streaming Movies', 'Streaming Music', 'Unlimited Data', 'Churn Category', 'Churn Reason', 'Avg
            Monthly Long Distance Charges', and 'Avg Monthly GB Download'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rows with 'Internet Service' set to 'No' had missing values in columns related to internet
            services; these were replaced with 'No' or 0 where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            After handling missing data, the data was prepared for analysis and modeling by encoding categorical
            variables. Binary encoding was applied to columns with two unique values (e.g., 'Yes'/'No',
            'Male'/'Female'), and one-hot encoding was used for nominal categorical variables. Ordinal
            encoding was used for 'Customer Status'.
        </p>

        <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>

        <p>
            Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the characteristics of the data. This included
            visualizing the distribution of categorical and numerical variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            For categorical variables, count plots were used to show the distribution of 'Contract', 'Internet
            Service', 'Online Security', 'Payment Method', and 'Customer Status'.
        </p>
        <p>
            For numerical variables, box plots were used to identify outliers in features such as 'Age', 'Tenure in
            Months', 'Monthly Charge' , 'Total Charges' etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            A correlation matrix was generated to explore the relationships between numerical features. Strong correlations were observed between 'Total Revenue' and 'Total Charges' (0.97)
            , 'Total Revenue' and 'Total Long Distance Charges' (0.78), and 'Total Charges' and 'Tenure' (0.85).
        </p>

        <h4>Model Selection and Training</h4>

        <p>
            Several machine learning models were trained to predict customer churn. The dataset was split into
            training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, ensuring stratification to maintain class balance.
            Numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler. The models used include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li>
            <li>Random Forest</li>
            <li>XGBoost</li>
            <li>Naive Bayes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each model was trained on the training data, and its performance was evaluated on the test data.
        </p>

        <h4>Results and Outcomes</h4>

        <p>
            The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports.
            Confusion matrices were also plotted to visualize the classification results.
        </p>

        <p>
            The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (85%), followed by Random Forest (84%), Logistic
            Regression (81%), and Naive Bayes (68%).
        </p>

        <p>
            Feature importance analysis using Random Forest and XGBoost models revealed that 'Contract Type'
            and 'Tenure in Months' were the most significant predictors of churn.
        </p>

        <p>
            The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn. The machine
            learning models developed can be used to predict churn and enable proactive retention efforts.
