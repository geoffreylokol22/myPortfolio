        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project focused on developing a machine learning model to detect potential fraud within the healthcare
            industry. Medical fraud is a serious issue that inflates costs and compromises the quality of care. My goal
            was to create a tool that could accurately identify fraudulent claims and activities.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The project involved a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data, including provider information, beneficiary
            details, and claim records (both inpatient and outpatient). I used Python and various machine learning
            libraries to preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, train classification models, and evaluate their
            performance. The key challenges included handling imbalanced data and the complexity of healthcare billing
            patterns.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>pandas</li>
            <li>numpy</li>
            <li>scikit-learn</li>
            <li>matplotlib</li>
            <li>seaborn</li>
            <li>xgboost</li>
            <li>lightgbm</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
        <h4>Data Loading and Preprocessing</h4>
        <p>
            The data was loaded from Excel files into pandas DataFrames. Missing values were addressed using appropriate
            imputation techniques, and columns with excessive missing data were removed. Categorical variables were
            encoded to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
        </p>

        <h4>Feature Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            I engineered new features to enhance the model's ability to detect fraud. These included metrics like claim
            duration, length of stay, beneficiary claim frequency, and indicators of past provider fraud.
        </p>

        <h4>Model Selection and Training</h4>
        <p>
            I experimented with several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and
            LightGBM. The models were trained and validated using techniques like train-test split and cross-validation.
        </p>

        <h4>Addressing Class Imbalance</h4>
        <p>
            Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset (fewer fraudulent cases than non-fraudulent), I employed techniques
            to mitigate bias and ensure the model effectively identified fraudulent instances.
        </p>

        <h3>Results and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
            The LightGBM model demonstrated strong performance in detecting medical fraud. On the validation set, the
            model achieved an overall accuracy of 84%. The ROC AUC score was 0.8038, indicating good discriminatory power.
            The specificity (True Negative Rate) was 0.94, and the sensitivity (Recall / True Positive Rate) was 0.67.
        </p>
        <p>
            These results suggest that machine learning can be a valuable tool for identifying potential fraud, leading to
            cost savings and improved efficiency in healthcare administration.
