        <h2>Unlocking Customer Insights: A Detailed SQL-Driven Analysis</h2>

        <p>
            This project focused on analyzing customer data to derive key insights into customer demographics,
            geographic distribution, and employment characteristics. The analysis utilized SQL queries to extract
            and process data from a dataset of 51,000 customer records. The findings provide a comprehensive view
            of customer attributes, enabling more informed business strategies.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>

        <p>
            The analysis involved several key steps, including data normalization, table creation, and data querying.
            SQL was employed to perform data selection, filtering, joining, and aggregation. The primary objective
            was to extract meaningful information about customers and their attributes to support business
            decision-making.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>SQLite</li>
            <li>Pandas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation Details</h3>

        <h4>Data Loading and Normalization</h4>

        <p>
            The customer data was loaded and normalized into several tables, including customer data, location,
            address, employment, and education. This normalization process facilitated efficient data querying
            and analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            Key tables created include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>customer_data:</b> Containing customer details like first name, last name, gender, email, phone,
                and IP address.</li>
            <li><b>location:</b> Storing geographic information such as city, country, country code, latitude,
                longitude, and time zone.</li>
            <li><b>address:</b> Including address details like street number, street name, street suffix, and full street
                address.</li>
            <li><b>employment:</b> Containing employment information like company name, department, job title, and
                LinkedIn skill.</li>
            <li><b>education:</b> Storing educational details such as title, university, and language.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Data Querying</h4>

        <p>
            SQL queries were used to extract and analyze data from the normalized tables. These queries performed
            various operations, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Selecting specific customer attributes (e.g., first name, last name, email).</li>
            <li>Filtering customers based on criteria such as gender or location.</li>
            <li>Joining tables to combine related data (e.g., customer data with location or employment data).</li>
            <li>Aggregating data to provide summaries (e.g., counting customers in each city, calculating average
                coordinates).</li>
            <li>Ordering results for better readability and analysis.</li>
            <li>Updating and deleting customer records.</li>
            <li>Identifying distinct values for attributes like countries, cities, and job titles.</li>
        </ul>
